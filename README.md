# Universal Android Debloater

**DISCLAIMER** : I am not responsible for thermonuclear war, you getting fired because you broke the alarm app or for anything that could happen to your phone actually.

But don't worry. This script *should* be safe as long as you only use my debloat lists and the stable release. If not, the worse thing you can do is preventing a essential system process to be loaded during boot thus causing an unfortunate bootloop. After about 5 failed system boot, the phone will automatically boot into recovery mode and you'll have to perform a FACTORY RESET. 

In any case, you can NOT brick your device with this script ! That's the main thing, right ? :smiley:

**Don't forget to backup importants things before doing anythings ! You can never be too careful**
