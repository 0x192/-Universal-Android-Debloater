Bash script using ADB for unrooted smartphones.

Don't worry, this script is pretty safe if you only use my debloat lists. The worse thing you can do is "deleting" (you don't delete actually -- cf.FAQ) a system packet essential to the system preventing the phone to boot correctly (bootloop). After about 5 failed system boot, the phone will automatically boot into recovery mode enabling you to do a FACTORY RESET. 

You can NOT brick your device with this script !
